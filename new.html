                <strong style="color: #000;">Definition:</strong> Term insurance is a type of life insurance policy that provides coverage for a specific period, or "term," of years. If the insured person dies during the term, the death benefit is paid to the beneficiary.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #555;">
                <strong style="color: #000;">Coverage Duration:</strong> Term insurance policies typically last for 10, 20, or 30 years. Some policies may offer coverage up to a certain age, like 65 or 70.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #555;">
                <strong style="color: #000;">Premiums:</strong> The premiums for term insurance are usually fixed and are typically lower than other types of life insurance. Premiums may increase if the policy is renewed after the initial term.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #555;">
                <strong style="color: #000;">Death Benefit:</strong> The death benefit is the amount paid to the beneficiary if the insured person dies within the policy term. This amount is chosen at the time of policy purchase.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #555;">
                <strong style="color: #000;">No Cash Value:</strong> Unlike whole life or universal life insurance, term insurance does not build cash value. It is purely a death benefit product.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #555;">
                <strong style="color: #000;">Renewability:</strong> Many term policies are renewable after the initial term expires, but the premium may increase based on the insuredâ€™s age at renewal.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #555;">
                <strong style="color: #000;">Convertibility:</strong> Some term insurance policies can be converted to permanent life insurance within a specified period, without requiring a medical exam. This feature provides flexibility as life circumstances change.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #555;">
                <strong style="color: #000;">Affordability:</strong> Term insurance is generally more affordable compared to permanent life insurance because it only provides coverage for a set period and does not include a savings component.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #555;">
                <strong style="color: #000;">Ideal for Specific Needs:</strong> Term insurance is ideal for covering financial responsibilities that will diminish over time, such as mortgages, children's education, or income replacement during working years.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #555;">
                <strong style="color: #000;">Simple and Straightforward:</strong> Term insurance policies are typically easier to understand and purchase compared to permanent life insurance policies, making them a popular choice for individuals seeking straightforward coverage.
